## What is Crystalline?

Crystalline is a cryptocurrency designed as a peer-to-peer network to store files, with built-in economic incentives to make sure all files are stored reliably over time. Crystalline uses a [redefined proof-of-Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08923) consensus as a security model, with a combined proof-of-Activity/proof-of-work mining system. Crystalline's intentions are similar to filecoin; however, it introduces many important innovations to the cryptocurrency field including a new security model, new consensus, and a new Activity-based mechanism.
This repository is purely a proof of concept and it is not to be used as a production build.
